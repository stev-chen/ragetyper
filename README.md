# ragetyper

Final Goal: A website that allows people to concurrently vent to a single page, where all words are simply added to the
global transcript as they are typed. There are no personal identifiers, just a big cloud of rage that keeps scrolling 
as it is added to.

TODO: Figure out a way to align text right to left, then bottom to top. Unfortunately, it appears there are no straightforward
solutions, and as a result there is massive whitespace in the bottom line when new lines are created.

TODO: Extend to support multiple active users, and a global transcript.
